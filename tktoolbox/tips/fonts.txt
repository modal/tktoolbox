Warnings:

The option database stores the name of the named font (not the Font object
itself). To create a font object from a font name use tkFont.Font(name=...,
exists=True).

If your original tkFont.Font object goes away (or any Font object
not created using exists=True) then the tk named font is also deleted. This is
to prevent memory leaks but it may catch you off guard if you decide to recreate
Font objects only when needed. If using tkFont.Font objects to configure widgets
always hold onto your original objects!
