Tkinter matches Tk quite closely, and there's no way to get *all* bindings
for a standard widget with a single call at the Tk level (afaik).

to extract this information from a Tkinter widget, you should first call
bindtags() on the widget to get a list of binding classes used for this widget,
and you can then use bind_class(cls) to get the events for that class.

to get all events, you can use something like:

>>> from Tkinter import Button
>>> b = Button()
>>> bindings = set()
>>> for cls in b.bindtags():

...     bindings |= set(b.bind_class(cls))  # s |= t means: update set s, adding elements from t
...
>>> bindings

set(['<Alt-KeyRelease>', '<Leave>', '<Enter>', '<KeyRelease-Alt_L>',
'<Key-Alt_R>', '<<PrevWindow>>', '<Key-F10>', '<KeyRelease-F10>',
'<Key-space>', '<Alt-Key>', '<Button-1>', '<ButtonRelease-1>',
'<KeyRelease-Alt_R>', '<Key-Tab>', '<Key-Alt_L>'])

</F>
