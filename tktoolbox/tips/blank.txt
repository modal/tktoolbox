Question:
I am just starting with Python.
When I use Tk, a blank dialog always opens up behind tkMessageBox or whatever other GUI element that one executes.
Is their a way of disabling this?

Answer:

The "blank dialog" is Tkinter's root window.
To eliminate that, explicitly create a root and withdraw it before proceeding:

       root = Tkinter.Tk()
       root.withdraw()
