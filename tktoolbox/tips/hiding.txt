Hiding Widgets

To hide a widget you have to make the geometry manager forget about it. For the
packer that is widget.pack_forget(), which forgets all about where the widget
goes -- a potential pain when it comes time to show the widget again. For grid
there's a nicer method widget.grid_remove() that remembers the grid settings for
the widget, so you can show it again by simply using widget.grid().

Problem: an enclosing frame will shrink as widgets are removed until it contains
only one widget; when you remove that one the frame does not shrink further (at
least this is true on a Mac using MacPython 2.0) This is a pain if you wish to
be able to remove all widgets from a frame and have it shrink to zero. The cheap
fix is to include an empty (hence tiny) frame in the enclosing frame and never
remove that. The enclosing frame will then shrink to basically nothing (the size
of the empty frame) when the last visible widget is removed.
